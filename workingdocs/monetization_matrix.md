# Bridge: User Roles, Permissions & Monetization Matrix

## 1. Guiding Principles

1. **Tax Success, Not Hope:** Startups should never pay to apply. We only make money when they make money.
    
2. **Liquidity First:** Barriers to entry for posting challenges (Clients) and applying (Startups) must remain zero to ensure a dense marketplace.
    
3. **Privacy is a Premium:** Anonymity and "Stealth Mode" are luxury features for mature entities.
    
4. **Connectors get Paid:** Scouts and Partners are the sales force; they generate revenue, they do not pay it.
    
5. **Cleared Funds Only:** We do not advance money. Payouts occur only after client funds have settled to prevent chargeback fraud.
    
6. **Cash Flow Acceleration (Bootstrap Mode):** To self-fund, we prioritize upfront service fees (Concierge/Listings) alongside lagging success fees.
    
7. **Startup Protection:** Success fees are a **Client Surcharge**, never a deduction. Startups receive 100% of the negotiated pilot value.
